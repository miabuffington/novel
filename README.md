# novel
This is my coding for our class project that required us to generate a novel. 
My inspiration for this project was to create a novel that resembles the perspective of a mother raising her kids. The concept is not complex by any means, but it is supposed to be symbolic of how a mother is viewed by their child throughout their lifetime as they grow up together. I changed what the child calls the mother and added punctuation to represent all of the interactions throughout a child and mother's time together. I think the result wasn't anything crazy, but to me it was special and sentimental because my mom and I are best friends, and this reminded me of her.
